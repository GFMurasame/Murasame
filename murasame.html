   <p>Hello all. So nice of you to find me here. I'll start with an introduction.
    <div>My name is Murasame.</div>
    I'm a musician and producer. For what genres?
    <div>Depends what you're after.</div>
    Yes, I will produce about anything. Though, for clarity's sake, I mainly produce rock, metal, funk and electronic music.
